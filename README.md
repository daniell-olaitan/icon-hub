This repository hosts a simple web land page project.

During the course of the project, I have learnt how to use simple CSS properties and how to apply rules in CSS. I have also learnt specificity, cascading and box model. Lastly, I have learnt how to use flex box for page layout.

All the above concepts are used in this project.
